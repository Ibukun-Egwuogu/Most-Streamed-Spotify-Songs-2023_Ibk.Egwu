# Most-Streamed-Spotify-Songs-2023_Ibk.Egwu
An analysis of Spotify’s 2023 streaming trends, highlighting top artists, songs, and acoustic features. This project showcases my curiosity and ability to uncover actionable insights, leveraging visualization techniques to interpret vast music data.


**RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON OBSERVATIONS FROM THE ANALYSIS OF MOST STREAMED SPOTIFY SONGS OF 2023**

 
**1. Top Artists by Stream Count:**
Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, and other leading artists should continue to engage fans by capitalizing on their popularity with exclusive content, live-streamed performances, or limited-edition releases. Spotify could feature them in curated playlists, personalized recommendations, and promotional campaigns to sustain high engagement with top artists. Fans of these top artists might benefit from Spotify notifications about new releases, concert updates, and artist-curated playlists.

 

**2. Top Streamed Song:**

Artists with popular songs like "Call Out My Name" should consider remix versions or collaborations to keep the song relevant and sustain its popularity. Spotify can create "most streamed" playlists or feature top songs in prominent placements to keep engagement high on trending tracks. Listeners could explore similar songs through Spotify’s recommendation engine or listen to curated playlists based on this popular song.

 

**3. Instrumental and Acoustic Percentage:**

Understanding listener preferences for instrumental and acoustic levels can help artists create diverse versions (e.g., acoustic or instrumental-only) of popular songs to appeal to different audience segments. Spotify could provide acoustic or instrumental playlists as part of their genre categorizations, offering listeners more tailored options. Listeners might appreciate having dedicated acoustic or instrumental playlists to enjoy music in varying forms.

 

**4.       Stream Count by Tempo (BPM):**

Given the popularity of certain BPMs, artists could experiment with these tempos in new releases to align with audience preferences. Spotify could create playlists based on popular BPMs to cater to listeners looking for music with specific energy levels, such as workout or relaxation playlists. Knowing popular BPM ranges could help listeners choose songs that match specific activities or moods, like high-energy songs for workouts or slower tempos for relaxation.

 

**5.       Energy Levels in Songs:**

High-energy music seems popular, so artists could incorporate this in future compositions, especially if targeting pop, dance, or workout playlists. Spotify could consider energy levels when curating mood-based playlists, such as "High Energy" or "Calm & Relaxing," making it easier for listeners to find music that suits their mood. Audience members could use the energy levels filter in Spotify to tailor playlists to fit their moods or activities.

 

**6.       Liveness:**

Artists should consider producing live versions or "unplugged" sessions for popular songs, as high-liveness tracks resonate well with listeners. Spotify could introduce a “Live” filter option, allowing users to discover and explore songs with high liveness or live performance playlists. Listeners could explore live recordings, concert playlists, or acoustic sessions for a more authentic music experience.

 

**7.       Top Artists in Playlists:**

High playlist inclusion indicates song popularity; artists should aim for their tracks to be featured in more playlists through strategic collaborations, genre alignment, or promotional campaigns. Spotify could reward artists with high playlist inclusion by featuring them in “Trending Now” or “Most Added to Playlists” sections. Fans might enjoy discovering new songs through frequently updated playlists with top artists.

 

**8.       Speechiness:**

Since low speechiness is preferred, artists should maintain a balance between spoken lyrics and melodic content, especially in genres like pop, rock, or R&B. Spotify might enhance genre-based or lyrical playlists by factoring in speechiness, such as creating spoken word or instrumental-only playlists. Fans looking for specific types of content (like purely lyrical or more instrumental music) can use filters based on speechiness.
